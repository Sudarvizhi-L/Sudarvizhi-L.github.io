Intro

I had a **wonderful experience** at the Bangalore Java User Group Meetup held on **July 12, 2025** — and it happened to be my **very first one**.

The event was hosted at **DevOn India**, and the day was packed with **four insightful sessions**:

*   **Google ADK using Java**
*   **Latest Java Language Features that simplify code**
*   **Virtual Threads in Java 21**
*   **DIY: Spring JDBC Client**

Learning & Takeaways

It was a **great learning opportunity** and a chance to deepen my understanding of what’s **new and evolving in the Java world**. Events like these not only help me grow **technically** but also **personally**, by engaging with an inspiring community of developers.

---------------

I'm truly **grateful for the experience** and am looking forward to attending **many more meetups in the future!**
