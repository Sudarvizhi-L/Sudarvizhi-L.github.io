description: "This project leverages machine learning and signal processing techniques to simulate the speech pattern of a specific human voice. It focuses on capturing distinct vocal characteristics and generating speech that closely resembles the target voice using advanced audio modeling. The system was trained and tested using a dataset of human speech samples, and includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning model implementation to achieve accurate simulation."
