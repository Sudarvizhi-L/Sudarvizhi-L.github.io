SQL Builder is an open-source Java library designed to simplify the process of writing complex SQL queries through a clean, fluent API. Instead of manually constructing query strings, developers can now build queries using method chaining that reflects the structure of actual SQL statements.

This tool is ideal for Java developers, database engineers, and students looking to learn how SQL queries are built and executed, while also making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Features

-  Write SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries with minimal boilerplate
-  Supports conditions, joins, ordering, grouping, pagination, and more
-  Fully compatible with JDBC â€“ pass the generated query directly to your database
-  Extensible design based on the Builder pattern

### Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java 17+
- Design Pattern: Builder Pattern for query construction
- Database Compatibility: Tested with H2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
- Testing Frameworks: JUnit 5 for unit testing
- Build Tools: Maven for dependency management and packaging

### Development Practices

- Version Control: Git + GitHub used for collaboration and task tracking
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions configured for automated testing and build validation
- Contribution Model: Issues and PR templates available to guide contributors
- Documentation: Each feature includes example code and unit test coverage

This library not only boosts developer productivity, but also serves as a *learning tool* by making the structure of SQL queries explicit and understandable within the Java ecosystem.
