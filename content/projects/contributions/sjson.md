*sjson* is an open-source project aimed at building a *lightweight JSON parser* completely from scratch in Java, without depending on libraries like org.json, Gson, or Jackson for parsing. It’s a low-level educational tool designed to give full control over how JSON data is read, interpreted, and validated.

The project supports complete JSON parsing capabilities with custom classes for each type and uses *Jackson* only in unit tests as a reference to validate correctness.



### Technologies Used

- *Java (Pure Core APIs)*: All parsing logic written using only core Java (Reader, char[], etc.).
- *JUnit 5*: Unit testing framework used to verify parser behavior.
- *Jackson Databind*: Used only in test cases to validate the correctness of parsed data.
- *Git & GitHub*: Code collaboration with issues, branches, pull requests, and CI.
- *Modular Design*: Each JSON type (JsonBoolean, JsonNumber, etc.) is implemented as a separate class for clarity and testing.

This project is a great example for those wanting to dive deep into how JSON works, or for environments where using full libraries would be overkill.
